There are rarely more than a couple of tellers working at any time. Bank branches that are more than 20 years old are now big, mostly empty rooms. With a dozen or more teller windows, only one or two are open.\n\nMost people simply don\'t require the services of a teller anymore, and it\'s not ATM\'s that are killing the jobs. It\'s online banking and electronic payments systems.\n\nNone of this is any indication that programming jobs are in big trouble, but you shouldn\'t be using [outdated tropes about banks and automation](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/8/15584268/eric-schmidt-alphabet-automation-atm-bank-teller) to make that point.

Like the previous BLS projection, that one will probably also end up being conservative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many branches a bank has. There are rarely more than a couple of tellers working at any time. Bank branches that are more than 20 years old are now big, mostly empty rooms. With a dozen or more teller windows, only one or two are open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people simply don&amp;#39;t require the services of a teller anymore, and it&amp;#39;s not ATM&amp;#39;s that are killing the jobs. It&amp;#39;s online banking and electronic payments systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this is any indication that programming jobs are in big trouble, but you shouldn&amp;#39;t be using &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/5/8/15584268/eric-schmidt-alphabet-automation-atm-bank-teller"&gt;outdated tropes about banks and automation&lt;/a&gt; to make that point. The &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm"&gt;BLS projects that programming jobs will decline by 10%&lt;/a&gt; in the next decade, but that&amp;#39;s less than it forecasts bank teller jobs to decline.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;',

Many things are now too expensive to develop and profit on it. With cheaper development there will be huge amount of new ideas being profitable, or affordable for gov and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we are just on the beginning of real digital transformation. There will be tons of software needed for general education, healthcare, governments and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im confident that for next 10-15 years demand for people in software development will even rise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;',
