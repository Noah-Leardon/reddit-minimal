## Experience Gained

This project served as a cap stone project for my Front-End journey. It stretched me, but I gained a lot of knowledge from this project. This was my first project built primarily using a TDD approach. It was strange and hard to get used to. As time went on I felt more confident writing, organizing, and diversifying the tests. This lead to a unique confidence in the code integrity that I hadn't previouslt known. Besides testing, this project also greatly increased my confidence with React, Redux, and CSS. I had to spend a lot of time with all three of them and learned many quirks about them along the way. Overall this project was challenging, yet rewarding and it made me confident in the areas I previously felt weak.
